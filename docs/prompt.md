Please use docs/Implementation.md as the main reference to complete the remaining steps for building the asynchronous Speech-to-Text system. Here are the requirements:

- How to run: Instructions should be suited for running inside the project's virtual environment.
- Design Pattern: Follow the existing design patterns and structure of the current project.
- Progress: Step 2 (building and copying whisper.cpp and its model files into the "whisper" directory) is complete.

Now, please provide comprehensive, step-by-step implementation guidance for all subsequent steps necessary to finish the system as described in Implementation.md.
